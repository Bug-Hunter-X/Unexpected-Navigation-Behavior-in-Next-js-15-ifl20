# Unexpected Navigation Behavior in Next.js 15

This repository demonstrates an unexpected navigation behavior in Next.js 15 when using both the `Link` component and the `useRouter` hook for navigation between pages.

## Bug Description

Navigating between pages using `Link` and `useRouter` can lead to issues like incorrect page rendering or the URL not updating as expected.  This seems to be more prevalent with dynamic routes.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate between the home page and the about page using the provided links and buttons.

You should observe the unexpected behavior described above.

## Potential Solution

The issue might be related to how Next.js 15 handles client-side navigation and the interaction between `Link` and `useRouter`.  A potential solution involves ensuring consistent routing strategies, avoiding unnecessary re-renders caused by state changes during navigation, and thoroughly checking how your data fetching mechanism is handling the route change.
